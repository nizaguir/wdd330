    <ul>
      <li>
        The syntax used by JavaScript is known as a C-style syntax because of
        its similarities with theC programming language
      </li>
      <li>
        A JavaScript program is made up of a series of statements. Each
        statement ends with a new line or semicolon. it’s considered best
        practice to combine the two and write each statement on a new line,
        terminated by a semi-colon, like so: <br />

        const message = 'Hello World!';<br />
        alert(message);
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript has a special operator called typeof for finding out the type
        of a value. <br />
        typeof 'hello' << 'string' typeof 10 << 'number' typeof true <<
        'boolean' typeof { ninja: 'turtle' } << 'object' typeof [ 1, 2, 3 ] <<
        'object' (All non-primitive data types return a type of 'object' .) "
      </li>

      <li>
        Declaring and Assigning: JavaScript uses the keywords const and let to
        declare variables. The keyword const is used when the variable will not
        be reassigned to another value, whereas let is used if the variable
        might be reassigned later in the program.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can even declare and assign multiple variables at the same time if
        you separate them with commas: let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;
      </li>
      <li>
        If the variable references a non-primitive data type, such as an array,
        function or object, then using const will not make itimmutable. This
        means the underlying data inside the objectcanchange (known
        asmutatingthe object). We can see this in the example below: const name
        = { value: 'Alexa' }; // an object name.value = 'Siri'; // change the
        value <<' 'Siri'
      </li>
      <li>
        Scope: Using const and let to declare variables means they areblock
        scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are declared
        in. Scope is an important concept in programming. It refers to where a
        constant or variable is accessible by the program. There are two common
        scopes that are often referred to in programs: global scope and local
        scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any variable declared outside of a block is said to haveglobal scope.
        This means it is accessible everywhere in the program. While this may
        seem to be a good idea at first, it is not considered good practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        In ES6, blocks can be used to create alocal scope. This means that any
        variables defined inside a block using the let or const will only be
        available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that block.
        This is known as having local scope, as the variable is only visible in
        the locality of the block.
      </li>

      <li>
        Variables that start with an underscore generally refer to private
        properties and methods, so it's best to not follow this convention for
        your own variable names.Constant and variable names are case sensitive,
        so ANSWER is different to Answer and answer .
      </li>

      <li>
        Strings: Create a string literal by writing a group of characters inside
        quote marks like this: 'hello' br If you want to use double quote marks
        inside a string literal, you need to use single quote marks to enclose
        the string. And if you want to use an apostrophe in your string, you
        will need to use double quote marks to enclose the string, otherwise the
        apostrophe will terminate the string, causing an error: <br />

        'It's me' // causes an error "It’s me" // this works <br />
        Another option is toescapethe quotation mark. You place a backslash
        before the apostrophe so it appears as an apostrophe inside the string
        instead of terminating the string <br />
        'It\'s me'
      </li>
      <li>
        The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as:
        <br />

        Single quote marks \' Double quote marks \" End of line \n Carriage
        return \r Tab \t
        <br />
        If you want to actually write a backslash, you need to escape it with
        another backslash: <br />

        "This is a backslash \\" << "This is a backslash \"
      </li>
      <li>
        We can access the properties of a string using dot notation. This
        involves writing a dot followed by the property we are interested in.
        For example, every string has a length property that tells us how many
        characters are in the string:
        <br />
        const name = 'Alexa'; // declare and assign a variable << 'Alexa'
        name.length; // retrieve the name variable's length property << 5;
      </li>

      <li>
        An alternative notation you can use to access a primitive data type's
        properties are square brackets: <br />

        name['length']; // note the property name is in quote marks << 5
      </li>
      <li>
        The concat() method can be used to concatenate two or more strings
        together: <br />

        'JavaScript'.concat('Ninja'); << 'JavaScriptNinja' 'Hello'.concat('
        ','World','!'); << 'Hello World!'
      </li>
      <li>Template Literals:Template literals use the backtick character, ` , to deliminate the string, as shown in the example below: <br> `Hello!`; <br>They also allow interpolation of JavaScript code. This means that a JavaScript expression can be inserted inside a string and the result will be displayed

      </li>
