  <h1>Ch1, Ch12 & Ch 15 Notes</h1>
  <h2>Forms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s possible, and becoming more and more common, to process the information in a form on the 'front end' before
      it is sent to the server using JavaScript</li>
    <li>Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. This value can be changed by a
      user
      entering information or interacting with the form’s interface (such as using a slider to increase or decrease a
      value). The value can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
    <li>The form has anameattribute ofsearch, and contains two controls: an input field where a user can enter a search
      phrase, and a button to submit the form. The form can also be submitted by pressing Enter.</li>
    <li>The action attribute is the URL that the form will be submitted to so it can be processed on the server side.
      The
      input field also has anameattribute ofsearchInputthat is used to access the information inside it.</li>
    <li>Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</li>
    <li>Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</li>
    <li>HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.</li>
    <li>document.formswill return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</li>
    <li>form.elementswill return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</li>
    <li>Forms havefocus,blur, andchangeevents that fire as a user interacts with the form.</li>
    <li>Forms also have asubmitevent that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.</li>
    <li>The information entered into a form can be read or updated using thevalueproperty of the form controls.</li>
    <li>The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a
      custom validation script may be required.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</li>
    <li>ES6 introduced class declarations that use theclasskeyword. These can be used in place of constructor functions.
    </li>
    <li>Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keywordthisrefers to the object returned by the
      function.</li>
    <li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.</li>
    <li>The prototype is live, so new properties and methods can be added to existing instances.</li>
    <li>The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, JavaScript will check
      whether its prototype has the method. If not, it will check that function’s prototype until it finds the method or
      reaches theObjectconstructor function.</li>
    <li>Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables usingconstand defining a function inside a
      constructor function. These can be made public using getter and setter functions.</li>
    <li>Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes. This should
      be done with caution as it can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work.</li>
    <li>A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance
      chain.</li>
    <li>Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference tothis.</li>
    <li>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
    <li>The value ofthisis not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors. This can be worked around by
      usingthat = this, using thebind(this)method and using arrow functions.</li>
    <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects.</li>
    <li>Composition over inheritance is a design pattern where objects are composed from 'building-block' objects,
      rather than inheriting all their properties and methods from a parent class.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.</li>
  <li>Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs. </li>
  <li>jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions. </li>
  <li> npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.</li>
  <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
  <li>ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file. </li>
  <li>The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.</li>
  <li>Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.</li>
  <li>React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.</li>
  <li>Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.</li>
  <li>Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.</li>
  <li>Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.</li>
  <li>Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing bodytag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.</li>
  </ul>
