  <h1>Ch10 Notes</h1>
  <li>
    Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than
    later.
  </li>
  <li>
    JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string"use strict". This
    can be used in a whole file or just a single function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and
    conventions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling
    it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.
  </li>
  <li>
    The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to
    interactively find and fix bugs in code.
  </li>
  <li>Exceptions can be thrown using thethrowstatement.</li>
  <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>
  <li>
    Any code placed inside atryblock will pass any error objects to
    acatchblock when an exception occurs. Any code inside afinallyblock will
    run if an exception does or does not occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then
    writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every
    time a new feature is implemented.
  </li>
  <li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</li>
