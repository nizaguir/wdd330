  <h1>Chaper 9: The Window Object</h1>
  <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>

  <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>

  <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of
    the program.</li>

  <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be
    unreliable.</li>

  <li>The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.</li>

  <li>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>

  <li>You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).</li>

  <li>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>

  <li>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>

  <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.</li>

  <li>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled
    using the clearTimeout() method.</li>

  <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the
    clearInterval() method.</li>

  <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the
    browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>


  <h2>Ch14 Notes: HTML5 APIs</h2>
  <li>HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, including
    several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.</li>

  <li>data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience
    with JavaScript.</li>

  <li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but
    without
    the same storage restrictions.</li>

  <li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user
    gives
    permission.</li>

  <li>The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid
    websites becoming unresponsive.</li>

  <li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.
  </li>
  <li>The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>

  <li>The <audio> and <video> elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also
        have a
        Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>
  <li>The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time
    using JavaScript.</li>

  <li>A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.</li>
